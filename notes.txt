General Presentation Notes
    The landscape of declarative programming
        C#, Java, Python
    What are decorators?
        Create simple example
        How do they work?
        What can we do with them?
        Logging, memoizing, readonly, controller, inject
    Examples of decorators in Angular 2
        Start with starter files and add a component and service
    Using ngForward in Angular 1.x
        Build out the same example
    Use my Civil War application for the A1 and A2 examples





Look for libraries that make Angular 1.x controllers look more like Angular 2 components

Metadata Reflection API (by Jonathan Turner)
    https://github.com/jonathandturner/decorators/blob/master/specs/metadata.md

Experiment with class, method, and parameter decorators
    What can you do with each of these???

What does support for decorators look like in Babel???
    Babel 5 had support
    Babel 6 currently does not... but you can add back support via a plug-in

Review MDN documentation for...
    Proxy
        ???
